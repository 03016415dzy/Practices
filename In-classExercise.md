Computer science is now a key problem solving tool in a broad range of industries and scientific disciplines. It is a rigorous academic discipline that is of great importance to everyone, not just those wanting to work in the computing industry. Just a little understanding provides access to a fantastic playground for young minds, where almost anything can be created and explored.   
    
Unfortunately, many young people are only ever exposed to ICT (Information Communications Technology）courses rather than the much broader, richer and exciting world of computing. 

Designing algorithms, using abstraction and decomposition to tackle large problems, selecting appropriate representations,learning how to build correct, robust and scalable systems are now key skills in the information age.

The phrase computational thinking was brought to the forefront of the computer science community as a result of an ACM Communications article on the subject by Jeannette Wing. The article suggested that thinking computationally was a fundamental skill for everyone, not just computer scientists, and argued for the importance of integrating computational ideas into other disciplines.

The characteristics that define computational thinking are decomposition, pattern recognition / data representation, generalization/abstraction, and algorithms. By decomposing a problem, identifying the variables involved using data representation, and creating algorithms, a generic solution results. The generic solution is a generalization or abstraction that can be used to solve a multitude of variations of the initial problem.

Scientists writing software need to write code that both executes correctly and can be easily read and understood by other programmers (especially the author's future self). 

If software cannot be easily read and understood, it is much more difficult to know that it is actually doing what it is intended to do. 

To be productive, software developers must therefore take several aspects of human cognition into account: in particular, that human working memory is limited, human pattern matching abilities are finely tuned, and human attention span is short.

Today’s computers and software are so complex that even experts  find it hard to predict which parts of any particular program will be performance bottlenecks. 

The most productive way to make code fast is therefore to make it work correctly, determine whether it’s actually worth speeding it up, and — in those cases where it is — to use a profiler to identify bottlenecks.

This strategy also has interesting implications for choice of programming language. 

Since faster, lower level, languages require more lines of code to accomplish the same task, scientists are most productive when they write code in the highest-level language possible, and shift to low level languages like C and Fortran only when they are sure the performance boost is needed.

Using higher-level languages also helps program comprehensibility.
